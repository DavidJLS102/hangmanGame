# Description
Our project is a hangman game that has 3 frames:
1. The first is a welcome to the game (Image 1).
2. The second Frame (Main) is the game that consists of the Scratch character that generates body parts according to the attempts when trying to guess the letter, additionally, there are 4 rows of buttons from A to Z that are deactivated once they are pressed, the reset button resets the scores in frame 3 which can be accessed with the "Scores" button, finally a TextPanel where the letters of the The word is updated only if the pressed button contains a letter of a random word generated from a database (Image 2).
3. The third frame is a score table for players 1 and 1, it has a button to return to the game, that is, to the Main (Image 3).
